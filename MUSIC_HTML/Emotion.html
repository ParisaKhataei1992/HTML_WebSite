        <H1>How Music Changes Our Mood</H1>
        <p>There is a 2 way relation between music and your mood. Not only when you are happy, you really like to listen to a pop or hip hop music, but also when you are sad and not in a good mood, a pop music or an electronic music can make you feel happy. There are many different genres of music and each has a different harmony, tune and feeling. In contrary, sometimes, a hip hop music can be annoying when you have a romantic dinner with your fianc√©. Imagine it is your birthday or graduation ceremony and you are very happy but a sad and slow classical music is playing. How would you react? You definitely want to listen to a very happy and fast bit music. On the other hand, a classical music or playing some particular instruments such as Cello, is very suitable when you are spending time with your partner either when having dinner or making love. It is the beauty of nature that everyone has own taste and every music can affect your mood and make it better or even worse.</aside>
