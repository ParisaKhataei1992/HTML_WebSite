        <H1>How Music Affects The Brain</H1>
        <p>Listening to music and playing a musical instrument, is one of the rare activities that involves the whole brain. Scientists believe that not only helps learning language, improving memory, focusing, attention and accuracy, but music can also be useful for physical coordination. But how?
            Musical activity involves almost every region and every neural system of brain. Music has different dimensions that have to be analyzed. “Listening to music starts with subcortical (below-the-cortex) structures—the cochlear nuclei, the brain stem, the cerebellum—and then moves up to auditory cortices on both sides of the brain. Trying to follow along with music that you know—or at least music in a style you’re familiar with, such as baroque or blues—recruits additional regions of the brain, including the hippocampus—our memory center—and subsections of the frontal lobe, particularly a region called inferior frontal cortex, which is in the lowest parts of the frontal lobe, i.e., closer to your chin than to the top of your head. Tapping along with music, either actually or just in your mind, involves the cerebellum’s timing circuits.” says Daniels J. Levitin in his book “This Is Your Brain on Music” in Aug 2006.

            Music can be annoying sometimes, however. When you want to concentrate on reading something important and someone is playing a very loud music, it distracts you from what you want to focus on. But some types of music like Classic music is always helping to concentrate and smoothly keeping your mind calm.
